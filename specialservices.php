            The marriage service in the Orthodox Church begins with the words, "Blessed is the Kingdom, of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit, now and ever and unto the ages of ages. Amen." This exclamation emphasizes the seriousness of marriage, and also the goal of marriage. According to the church canons, those Orthodox Christians who marry outside the Church are deprived of the sacraments of the Church. Some people find this shocking; they feel the Church is being too harsh. But the question is: What gives validity to marriage? From a spiritual standpoint, what gives meaning to a marriage? Unlike the wedding ceremonies in most non-Orthodox churches, marriage in the Orthodox Church is not a contract—a legal agreement with the exchange of vows or promises— between two people. Rather, marriage is the setting up, by two people, of a miniature church, a family church, wherein people may worship the true God and struggle to save their souls. It is also a family church that is in obedience to Christ's Church. As Saint Basil the Great says, it is natural to marry, but it must be more than natural; it must be a yoke, borne by two people under the Church.<br><br>

Thus we see that in New Testament times the focus of marriage was switched from a primary purpose of producing children, to a primary purpose of providing a way for human beings to save their souls. The wedding ceremony itself is filled with rich symbolism that makes this whole aspect of marriage very clear.<br><br>
<b>The Husband's Responsibilities</b><br>
<i>The husband is the head of the wife...</i><br>

We know that every organization, every institution—whether it be the Church, a parish, a monastery, or, in the world, a bank, a corporation, a school—must have a head, a leader. The same is true of a successful marriage, for the family is also a unit, a spiritual and physical organization. According to Holy Scripture and Sacred Tradition, the leader in a marriage is the husband. Again, the words of Saint Paul: The husband is the head of the wife... He is the leader. He represents the principle of authority in the family. Just as the priest is the spiritual leader of the parish, and responsible to God for the parishioners, and thus the spiritual authority in the parish, so too the husband is the priest in his family, responsible for setting the tone of family life.<br><br>
This does not means that he is superior to his wife. In Christ's sight, all are equal; there is neither male nor female. In fact, marriage is a partnership of equals. Let there be no mistake: there is no room for chauvinism of any kind in Orthodoxy. Nor does being the head give a husband any kind of dictatorial, tyrannical, arbitrary, or absolute authority over his wife and children. But, as with every position of importance, certain responsibilities go with this one, and they are very heavy, very difficult, but also very challenging and potentially creative responsibilities.<br><br>
<b>The Responsibilities of the Wife</b><br>
<i>Saint Paul says, Wives, submit yourselves unto your own husbands, as unto the Lord ... (Eph. 5:22, 24)</i><br>
  A wise wife will encourage her husband to be a leader, a real man, a true man, faithful to his divinely ordained nature; she will not try to take on the position of authority herself. Psychologists tell us that the anger a woman feels towards a man who has allowed her to take over the leadership of the family is the deepest anger of all. <br><br>

<b> Characteristics of a Successful Marriage</b><br>
Experience tells us that two people get married and immediately begin to discover how very different they are. The fact is, we don't really even begin to know ourselves until we are married. We live too close to ourselves. It really does take someone else to help us to see ourselves as we really are. One of the fringe benefits of a good marriage is that one acquires a built-in psychiatrist: a good spouse who cares enough to listen without having to be paid for it! We know that many emotional illnesses are a result of a person having some inner burden weighing on him which he had never been able to really share with someone else. In a good marriage, husband and wife share their burdens with one another, and this sharing is without reservation, without having to worry about how the other person will react, without having to keep up a front.<br><br>
           There are many characteristics that a successful marriage has, but in my view the three most important are these:<br>

1. <i>Praise.</i><br> No marriage can prosper if there is no praise. Everyone in life needs to feel appreciated at some point by someone. And nothing can kill love faster than continual criticism. When we husbands and wives praise each other—in small ways as well as in big ways—we are also saying to one another: I love you; I value you. Praise nurtures a good marriage. And it is the one characteristic that is most lacking in modern marriages.<br><br>

2. <i>Forgiveness.</i> <br>Forgiveness is essential for a happy marriage. When couples ask me, "Do you think our marriage can survive?" my answer is always, "Yes, providing you are willing to forgive each other." And this forgiveness should not be just after a major crisis in a family. It should be every single day. In a successful marriage, a husband and wife are constantly asking forgiveness of each other. When we don't do this, wounds don't get healed. We grow apart from each other. We grow cold towards one another, and we don't obtain the blessings that God sends down on husbands and wives that mutually forgive one another.<br><br>

3. <i>Time.</i><br> A successful marriage takes time. It does not happen overnight. It must grow. It is a long and difficult process; like all good things in life, it comes through considerable effort and struggle. Those of you not yet married, or on the verge of marriage, should remember this: we live in a society of instantaneous gratification—we want what we want, when we want it, and that when is now. And this impatience on our part has had a very destructive effect on marriages, even in the Orthodox Church. If we have no patience with each other, and are not willing to give many years to working out a successful marriage, then our marriage is doomed.<br><br>
       <b>The Rite:</b><br> Two separate services, betrothal and crowning. Betrothal is relatively short containing a set of petitions and three prayers. Characterized by the putting on of the rings, it signifies the couple's voluntary pledge to enter marriage and to live together in faith, harmony, truth, and love. Crowning is longer and more complex with petitions, several prayers, two scripture readings, joining of hands, partaking of blessed wine from the common cup, and a solemn joyous procession. It is culminated with the actual crowning. Readings- Eph. 5.20-33, John 2.1-11.<br><br>
           <b>Days When Marriage Is Not Permitted:</b><br>
Marriages are not performed on fast days or during fasting seasons; these include the Great Lent and Holy Week, August 1-15, August 29 (Beheading of St. John the Baptist), September 14 (Exaltation of the Holy Cross), and December 13-25. Nor are marriages celebrated on the day before and the day of a Great Feast of the Lord, including Theophany (January 5 and 6), Pascha, Pentecost, and Christmas (December 24 and 25).<br><br>
           Canonical and theological reasons preclude the Orthodox Church from performing the Sacrament of Marriage for couples where one partner is Orthodox and the other partner is a non-Christian.<br>

             <h2 id="moleben" style="text-align:left">Prayer of Supplication/Molieben</h2>

<div class = "col-2 col-s-2" style="float:left;"><img class="imggif" src="images.png" alt="St. George" style="height:auto; width:100%; float:left; padding:10px"></div>
Molieben (from Church Slavonic Mol'ba - prayer, supplication) is a short liturgical service usually centered on a particular need or occasion: the new year, a journey, an illness, an act of thanksgiving, etc. It may be addressed to Christ, the Mother of God, or to saints. Its general structure is that of Matins, and it can be served either by request of the faithful or by decision of the parish Priest.<br><br>

The Church asks us to "pray without ceasing" - Prayer is the life of the Church and the life of each one of us, members of the Church. And because Christ came to redeem and to sanctify the totality of our life, no part of that life, no human need, no occasion is excluded from the Church's prayer. The Molieben, thus, is the extension of the Church's prayer, of Christ's redeeming grace to all aspects and realities of our life. "...knock and it will be opened to you." --we are called constantly to knock at the doors of God's mercy and our faith assures us that God hears us and is with us. <br><br>

<h3>FUNERALS AND PANNYHIDAS</h3>
<i>by priest Sergei Sveshnikov</i><br>

<div class = "col-2 col-s-2" style="float:left;"><img class="imggif" src="images (3).jpeg" alt="St. George" style="height:auto; width:100%; float:left; padding:10px"></div>

<b>The final hours before death</b></br>
The leaving behind of the earthly life full of suffering, and the translation into eternity is the
most solemn moment in the life of any Christian. However, friends and relatives, sometimes
removed from Christian traditions, bear the death of a dear one with great grief. They often
lose their orientation and leave the important job of the setting an Orthodox Christian on his
final path in the hands of a funeral home.<br><br>
The most important thing that we can do for a friend or relative before his or her death is to
invite a priest, so that he can send the departing one on his or her way with the Holy Gifts. One
must not worry about Father being busy or tired, or that it is too early, or too late, or too far.<br><br>
One must simply fulfill oneʼs responsibilities before the dear friend. One must neither be
concerned with thoughts of whether the sick one will get well. If this is Godʼs will, then he will,
and if the hour of the meeting with eternity has come, then nothing can delay this hour, but all
is in the hands of God. It is entirely unnecessary to be at deathʼs door in order to commune of
the Holy Mysteries of Christ. While there is still time, let the priest come and commune the sick
one, pray for his recovery, and perform the sacrament of oil blessing (unction).<br><br>
Finally, the important moment of passing from temporal to eternal has come to our dear one. If
the priest has not yet arrived, then we can and should begin to read the service on the
departure of the soul from the body, that is, the particular rule of prayers which is read while a
person is still alive, but cannot pray with his own lips. In this service, the sick one joins in heart
and soul to the words of the prayers that we read, and offers them up to the creator. It seems
wrong, even if it is sincere, to simply mourn, depriving our friend of this final prayerful comfort
in this life, and increasing his sufferings, which were already enough without this deprivation.<br><br>
<b>Funeral and burial</b><br>
The body of a reposed Orthodox Christian is washed, clothed in clean clothing, covered with a
burial sheet, and a special headband is placed on his head to remind us of the incorruptible
wreaths of righteousnes, which the Lord has prepared for those who love Him (cf. 2 Tim. 4:8).
A cross is placed in the reposedʼs hands as a symbol of the fact that this person, taking up his
cross, followed after Christ (Lk. 9:23).<br><br>
The burial of an Orthodox Christian can be on the first day after death, the second day, the
third day, or later, depending on conditions. The coffin with the body of the reposed is brought
to the church, where the burial services are held. The day and time of the funeral, in our
church, must be pre-arranged with the rector. An Orthodox Christian should be buried in an
Orthodox Cemetery, where this is possible.<br><br>
<b>Forty day commemoration</b><br>
The Russian word “Sorokoust” refers to the commemoration of a reposed Orthodox Christian
at Liturgy every day for forty days after death, as in the first forty days after death, the newlypresented
soul has special need of our prayers. Forty day commemoration is possible only in
those churches that have daily Liturgy, usually these are cathedrals with a great number of
priests, or monasteries. In the majority of parish churches, where one or two priests serve,
Liturgy is not served daily, and thus forty day commemoration is not possible. In our Western
American diocese, forty day commemoration can be ordered at the cathedral church in San
Francisco. For more information, see the rector.<br><br>
<b>Memorial dinners</b><br>
Memorial dinners and services are held on the third, ninth, and fortieth days after death, and
also on the anniversary of the death. If possible, not only friends and relatives should be
invited, but also the poor, lonely, and sorrowing. Besides this, it is a praiseworthy custom to
help the poor and donate to worthy causes in memory of a departed one.<br><br>
<b>Pannykhidas</b><br>
A pannykhida is an order of church prayers for a reposed Orthodox Christian. Pannykhidas
may be served not only on the third, ninth, and fortieth days and on the anniversary of the
death, but also on the reposedʼs nameʼs day or any other appropriate day (besides certain
well-known days of the year). In our church, one must contact the rector and agree on a day
and time to order a pannykhida.<br><br>
One may bring kollyvo to a pannykhida. This is boiled wheat with honey or sweet fruits added.
The wheat reminds us that we are buried in the ground in order to be resurrected into new life.
The honey and sweet fruits remind us of the sweetness of the future life with God.<br><br>
<b>How much does it cost?</b><br>
Prayers for the reposed, as all other prayers, are priceless. They cannot be bought or sold.
However, it is tradition to thank the priest for his time and efforts, and also contribute to the
upkeep of the church. The amounts of these donations are decided on by the relatives of the
reposed in accordance with their financial situation. Poverty or financial difficulties should
never be an impediment to serving a funeral or pannykhida. To pray for the departed is the
duty of every priest, the fulfillment of which is far more important than any sum of money.<br>

                     <h3>THE MEANING OF THE CHRISTIAN BAPTISM</h3>
<i>St. Nektarios Greek Orthodox Church</i><br>

      <div class = "col-2 col-s-2" style="float:left;"><img class="imggif" src="orthodox-christmas-clipart-angel2.gif" alt="St. George" style="height:auto; width:100%; float:left; padding:10px"></div>
    Jesus teaches that to enter His Kingdom, we must be
baptized by “water and the Holy Spirit” (John 3:5) Our
entrance into the Kingdom is an entrance into the life of
the Church, as this is where the Kingdom of God is made
real in the world. This entrance begins with the Holy
Mysteries (Sacraments) of Baptism and Chrismation. In
these Holy Mysteries, we receive the grace of God through
the baptismal water and the holy “chrism”, which is a seal
of the gift of the Holy Spirit. The following is an
explanation of the major elements in the Orthodox
Mystery of initiation.<br><br>

 In the Ancient Church, the first step in membership was
to become a student, or “catechumen” of the Church in
preparation for baptism. During this time, one would be
taught the basic truths of the Faith. As the catechumens
are no longer a formal order in the Church, this service is
now usually celebrated as the beginning of the Baptism
service. As baptism is a Mystery of entry into the Church,
these opening prayers are done at the back of the church
building, as part of a formal (and literal) entrance into the
church.<br><br>
<b>The Exorcism Prayers:</b><br> The priest calls upon the Holy
Spirit to expel Satan and all his angels from the
presence of the candidate for baptism. He prays that
the spirits of evil may not lay hold of him/her by
temptation or any other torment. The priest blows on
the candidate cross-wise three times to symbolize the
exorcising power of the Holy Spirit—the Hebrew and
Greek words for “spirit” also mean “breath.”<br><br>
<b> The Renunciation of Satan:</b><br> The candidate and
sponsors turn to face the west, the entrance of the
church. West is symbolic of darkness, since the sun
sets the west. Through this movement the devil, the
“lord of darkness”, is confronted and rejected, along
with “and all his works, all his worship, all his angels,
and all his pomp.”<br><br>
<b>The Acceptance of Christ:</b><br> Turning back to face the
east, towards the Altar, symbolizing the Light of
Christ, the candidate and sponsors accept Jesus “as
King and as God.” They affirm this acceptance by
repeating the words of the Nicene Creed, which
outlines the Church’s basic beliefs about God,
Church, and salvation.</br></br>
                     <b>The Baptismal Candles:</b><br> One of the terms used in
Orthodoxy when referring to baptism is “Holy
Illumination,” since it is through baptism that Christ,
the Light of the World, enters in our hearts. The
baptismal candles are lit after the baptism to
symbolize the newly acquired light of Christ which
baptized Christians carry with them throughout their
lives. They are now “newly illumined.”<br><br>
<b>The Oil of Gladness:</b><br> After the opening proclamation
and litany, the candidate is anointed with oil. In
ancient times oil was used as a salve to cover
wounds, protecting them so that they could heal
faster. The anointing with the “Oil of Gladness” is a
symbol of baptism as an act which heals our broken
relationship with God.<br><br>
<b>The Baptism:</b><br> The candidate is immersed in the
baptismal font in the name of the Father, the Son,
and the Holy Spirit. Entering the font, which
symbolizes the tomb and the womb- death to the old
person life to the new, s/he joins Christ in His burial;
coming up out of it s/he takes part in Christ’s
resurrection from the tomb. The candidate is “born
again,” literally “born from above”, into a new life in
Christ Jesus.<br><br>
<b>A Garment of Righteousness:</b><br> After the baptism, the
candidate is dressed in white, symbolizing their new
life as a servant of Christ. Baptismal hymn: “Grant me
a brilliant new garment you who clothe yourself with
light as a robe…”<br><br>
 <b>The Chrismation (Confirmation):</b> <br>The Orthodox Church
maintains the ancient practice of confirming the newly
baptized Christian immediately after his/her baptism.
Just as baptism is a personal “Pascha” (Easter) for each
of us, making us partakers in Christ’s personal
Pentecost, as the Holy Spirit descends upon us,
confirming us as full members of the Church. The act of
confirmation is done through an anointing with a special
oil mixed with spices (Exodus 30:31-34) for consecration
(dedicating to God) called “Chrism,” from the Greek
word meaning “gift” -as in, the gift of the Holy Spirit.<br><br>
<b>The Baptismal Procession:</b> <br>The priest leads the newly
baptized and his/her sponsors around the font,
beginning their life long walk with Christ, singing “all
who have been baptized in Christ…”<br><br>
<b>Giving of the Cross:</b><br> Giving of the cross symbolizes that
we now belong to Christ and have taken up our cross
and follow Him.<br><br>
<b>Eucharist:</b><br> The physical acceptance and unification of
Christ. This is an act which must be repeated throughout
an Orthodox Christian’s life in order to remain “in
communion” with the Church (body of Christ).<br><br>
<b>The Scripture Readings:</b><br>
&#9632Romans 6:3-11 – All of those who are baptized in Christ
share in His death and resurrection.<br>
&#9632Matthew 28:16-20 – Jesus instructs His disciples to
preach the Gospel to all peoples, baptizing them in the
name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit.<br><br>
<b>The Post-Baptismal Rites:</b><br>In the ancient Christian baptismal rites, the baptism itself
would end at this point, and all of the rites following would
be celebrated one week later. During this week, the newlybaptized
would receive further teachings about the Faith.<br><br>
<b>The Washing of The Oil:</b><br> The priest washes the holy oil
and Chrism off the candidate. This washing is
understood as part of the newly-baptized Christian’s
final preparation for entering into the world as a disciple
and witness of Jesus Christ.<br><br>
<b>The Tonsure:</b><br> As Christians we are called to offer our
entire life to the Lord. As a symbolic first-offering, the
candidate’s hair is cut. Hair, in the Biblical story of
Samson is equated with strength; thus the hair offered
stands for all the person’s strength and potentials given
over to God.<br><br>

         <h3>ON THE BLESSING OF HOMES ON
THEOPHANY</h3>
<i>by priest Sergei Sveshnikov</i><br>

<div class = "col-2 col-s-2" style="float:left;"><img class="imggif" src="christ.jpg" alt="St. George" style="height:auto; width:100%; float:left; padding:10px"></div>
     <b>Why Bless a Home?</b><br>
The Orthodox Church teaches that we do not
have two separate lives–a secular one and a
spiritual one–but one human life, and that all of
it must be holy. We must not be Christians for
just a few hours on Saturday and Sunday,
spending the rest of our life godlessly, that is to
say, without God. The person who has united
with Christ in the sacrament of baptism cannot
be a part-time Christian, but must be faithful to
Christ everywhere and at all times–in church, at
work, at home, in relationships with other
Christians, and in those with non-Christians–we
must be faithful to Christ in the fullness of our
life.<br><br>
The Holy Orthodox Church teaches us that a
temple is not only a building in which we
worship, but that we are temples of the Holy
Spirit (1 Cor. 3:16); that the Body of Christ is not
only that of which we partake at the Divine
Liturgy, but that we are the Body of Christ (1
Cor. 12:27). And just as the Gifts of the
Eucharist are treated with reverence and kept in
sanctified vessels in the altar, so should every
Christian’s life be full of reverence and sanctity
not only during a church service, but likewise
outside the walls of the temple. A Christian’s
home must become a small temple, work–labor
for the glory of God, and family–a small Church.  <br><br>
The Orthodox Church helps her children strive
for holiness in their lives and brings
sanctification to every Christian home–a small
temple. The Church blesses the very
foundation of a home in the same way that it
blesses the foundation of a church, it blesses a
new Christian home in the same way that it
blesses a new temple, and yearly, after the
blessing of a parish temple with the water of
Theophany, the Church brings this holy water
into the homes of the faithful. The prayers for
the blessing of a temple are different from those
for the blessing of a home, because the function
of a home is different from that of a temple, but
the sanctifying action of the Holy Spirit is one.
And just as in the baptism of our Lord all of
creation is washed clean and sanctified, every
year after the feast of the Baptism of the Lord
(January 19, according to the secular calendar)
Christians sanctify themselves and their homes
with the water of Theophany.<br><br>
The Church teaches us to sanctify everything:
dwellings, places of work, all our pursuits, and
the fruits of our labor. And just as a temple and
sacred vessels, once sanctified and set aside
for sacred use, can no longer be used for
anything profane, in the same way a Christian
washed in the baptismal waters, and his home,
and all his works can no longer be the dwelling
of sin and the works of satan, but only and
always–the temple of the Holy Spirit and the
fulfillment of the will of our Heavenly Father.
This is why the Church blesses everything that
can be found in a Christian home; and if
something is not worthy of being blessed, then
there should not be a place for it in the home of
a Christian.<br><br>
<b>How Much Does It Cost?</b><br>
The prayer of the Church is priceless; it can be
neither sold nor bought. The Church equally
blesses the home of every Christian, regardless
of his financial situation. However, we must
note the obvious: it is not only angels who come
to bless our homes, but together with them
come the ministers of the altar–people very
much like the rest of us, who also must take
care of their families, and to whom petrol is
dispensed only for money, just like to all of us.
Thus, it is customary to make a donation to the
clergy for their time and work. The amount of
this donation is determined solely by each
family’s individual circumstances and
considerations.<br><br>
<b>The Blessing of a Home</b><br>
In order to have your home blessed for the first
time or to arrange for a yearly Theophany
blessing, you must personally contact the
Rector of your parish church. Historically,
clergy could walk to every home in their parish
and bless it on the very day of Theophany. In
our current situation in the United States, when
many parishioners live tens of miles from the
church, it is important to approach the Rector in
advance and arrange for an appropriate time for
his visit.<br><br>
For a yearly Theophany blessing of a home
prepare a small table in your icon corner
covered with a clean cloth, candles, and a
vessel with holy water. For a first-time blessing
of a home it is also necessary to prepare a very
small amount of pure olive oil.<br><br>
Although parishioners often wish for the priest
to stay for dinner or supper after the blessing of
their home, it is necessary to remember that the
priest may be blessing several homes in one
day and cannot physically eat several dinners
and/or suppers in a row. Do not be offended if
the priest must hurry away to another home.
Long spiritual talks over a cup of tea are very
important, but it is equally as important to find
for them a proper time on a different day, or to
ensure in advance that the priest has time after
the blessing of your home.<br><br>
